`So I was coming from home one day and outside of my apartment complex, there it was. It was sitting there so innocently. Just over there, leaning against a wall. A huge, full, mouth-watering bucket of urine. It was as if the golden liquid of the dehydrated mammal was calling to me, since I instantly dropped my briefcase and picked up the bucket with my hands that have been awaiting to hold a bucket of urine for a long time. It really was like a dream come true. I accidentally splashed some of the urine out of the bucket while I was picking it up, and I am still, 3 months later, truly devastated and ashamed by that blunder of mine. That liquid was just too good to waste. I got into the elevator and pressed on my floor button with my now piss-drenched fingers. Once I reached my floor, the elevator doors opened and my next-door neighbour was right there. She was initially jamming to her tunes and had a smile on her face, then after the fantastic scent of the urine hit her she immediately became visibly repulsed. I asked her "Do you want some? I got enough to share!" She, however, did not want any of my bucket urine and exclaimed "Go away!" before running down the staircase. I shrugged it off and managed to fish the apartment key out of my pocket and insert it into the door without putting down the bucket. Once I was in, I instantly cleared out my refrigerator and put the bucket in, and then covered the bucket with some plastic wrap so no gas piss would escape. Next, I quickly took out my laptop and googled "recipes with urine in them", hoping to find some yummy recipes that other urine enthusiasts around the world have contributed to. I was sorely disappointed, and only managed to find a recipe for urine cocktail sauce. I, however, am a master of improvisation. Over the next two months, all I did was find creative ways to ingest urine. Of course I drank some of it, in fact I think I drank around a third of the entire bucket at the end of the day.
However, I also put it into my mashed potatoes, used it as salad dressing, substituted it instead of milk in my cereal, and so much more.`,

`What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.`

`I just downvoted your post.

# FAQ

# What does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your post and Reddit account has decreased by one.

# Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a post to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

* Rudeness towards other Redditors,
* Spreading incorrect information,
* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.

# Am I banned from the Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making posts like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

# I don't believe my post deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

# How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.`

`I am an incoming first-year student, who wants to study either Mathematics Specialist or Mathematics and Physics Specialist. I wasn't a stellar high school student but got by as I could with a medium to high effort, sometimes with a low effort with subjects that I was not thrilled about. I graduated early with a grade of 88 from a high school in a small town. It has come to my attention that Mathematics Specialist and Mathematics and Physics Specialist tend to have a large body of intelligent students where intelligence is defined by Intelligent Quotient(IQ) in Psychology literature. Some might disagree with the validity of IQ but to my knowledge as I have regularly watched Psychology lectures from Jordan Peterson and MIT OpenCourseWare, It is undeniable that IQ scores are major predictors in accessing your brain processing speed--though I am no psychologist-- and, as a result, how well you will do in jobs that deal with complex and abstract concepts. I understand that among Big Five Personality Traits, conscientiousness plays a big part in your success. I feel like as I have not failed high school but was not a particularly excellent in high school except in mathematics in which I exceeded the student body because I really persevered in mathematics alone, my IQ should stand at just above the average IQ and my conscientiousness at average. I can see that this is not a very precise way to derive IQ from but I see it as a very rough approximation. How do you deal with this dilemma where I must choose to major in what I want but might not be intelligent enough to be successful in it so that I can go to a graduate school? I know I will work to get good marks but the said dilemma still concerns me.`

`I thought the guy beside me on third floor Robarts washroom was just wiping furiously but then... I realized the rhythm was too precise, too repeatable. Each wipe was filled with confidence and intent. I can clearly hear his breathing technique. And then I came to a sudden realization that we're not two guys taking a dump on the toilets. No, it's me taking a dump while listening to another guy masturbating... Come on man, just do it in the private washroom or something.`

`What the actual fuck. I scored a 95 throughout high school, scored a full 800 in the SAT math and another 800 in the SAT math level 2 paper, but my first UOFT MAT137 grade is 6.5/22? First the assignment questions are nothing like what is done in the classes or the videos. Second the marking, they really cut half my marks for not using the exact same structure as them.

I’ll fucking show up at your house when you aren’t home. I’ll turn all the lights on in your house, leave all the water running, open your fridge door and not close it, and turn your gas stove burners on and let them waste gas. You’re going to start stressing the fuck out, your blood pressure will triple, and you’ll have a fucking heart attack. You’ll go to the hospital for a heart operation, and the last thing you’ll see when you’re being put under in the operating room is me hovering above you, dressed like a doctor. When you wake up after being operated on, wondering what ticking time bomb is in your chest waiting to go off. You’ll recover fully from your heart surgery. And when you walk out the front door of the hospital to go home I’ll run you over with my fucking car out of no where and kill you. I just want you to know how easily I could fucking destroy your pathetic excuse of a life, but how I’d rather go to a great fuckng length to make sure your last remaining days are spent in a living, breathing fucking hell. It’s too late to save yourself, but don’t bother committing suicide either… I’ll fucking resuscitate you and kill you again myself you bitch-faced phaggot. Welcome to hell, population: you`
