It was sitting there so innocently. Just over there, leaning against a wall. A huge, full, mouth-watering bucket of urine. It was as if the golden liquid of the dehydrated mammal was calling to me, since I instantly dropped my briefcase and picked up the bucket with my hands that have been awaiting to hold a bucket of urine for a long time. It really was like a dream come true. I accidentally splashed some of the urine out of the bucket while I was picking it up, and I am still, 3 months later, truly devastated and ashamed by that blunder of mine. That liquid was just too good to waste. I got into the elevator and pressed on my floor button with my now piss-drenched fingers. Once I reached my floor, the elevator doors opened and my next-door neighbour was right there. She was initially jamming to her tunes and had a smile on her face, then after the fantastic scent of the urine hit her she immediately became visibly repulsed. I asked her "Do you want some? I got enough to share!" She, however, did not want any of my bucket urine and exclaimed "Go away!" before running down the staircase. I shrugged it off and managed to fish the apartment key out of my pocket and insert it into the door without putting down the bucket. Once I was in, I instantly cleared out my refrigerator and put the bucket in, and then covered the bucket with some plastic wrap so no gas piss would escape. Next, I quickly took out my laptop and googled "recipes with urine in them", hoping to find some yummy recipes that other urine enthusiasts around the world have contributed to. I was sorely disappointed, and only managed to find a recipe for urine cocktail sauce. I, however, am a master of improvisation. Over the next two months, all I did was find creative ways to ingest urine. Of course I drank some of it, in fact I think I drank around a third of the entire bucket at the end of the day.\nHowever, I also put it into my mashed potatoes, used it as salad dressing, substituted it instead of milk in my cereal, and so much more.'},{category:"navy seal",text:"What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch?

These include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Rudeness towards other Redditors,\n* Spreading incorrect information,\n* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.\n\n# Am I banned from the Reddit?\n\nNo - not yet. But you should refrain from making posts like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.\n\n# I don't believe my post deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?\n\nSure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.\n\n# How can I prevent this from happening in the future?\n\nAccept the downvote and move on.

I wasn't a stellar high school student but got by as I could with a medium to high effort, sometimes with a low effort with subjects that I was not thrilled about. I graduated early with a grade of 88 from a high school in a small town. It has come to my attention that Mathematics Specialist and Mathematics and Physics Specialist tend to have a large body of intelligent students where intelligence is defined by Intelligent Quotient(IQ) in Psychology literature. Some might disagree with the validity of IQ but to my knowledge as I have regularly watched Psychology lectures from Jordan Peterson and MIT OpenCourseWare, It is undeniable that IQ scores are major predictors in accessing your brain processing speed--though I am no psychologist-- and, as a result, how well you will do in jobs that deal with complex and abstract concepts. I understand that among Big Five Personality Traits, conscientiousness plays a big part in your success. I feel like as I have not failed high school but was not a particularly excellent in high school except in mathematics in which I exceeded the student body because I really persevered in mathematics alone, my IQ should stand at just above the average IQ and my conscientiousness at average. I can see that this is not a very precise way to derive IQ from but I see it as a very rough approximation. How do you deal with this dilemma where I must choose to major in what I want but might not be intelligent enough to be successful in it so that I can go to a graduate school? I know I will work to get good marks but the said dilemma still concerns me."},{category:"normal",text:"I thought the guy beside me on third floor Robarts washroom was just wiping furiously but then...
